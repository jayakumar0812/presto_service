# **Architecture Decision Record: Presto Server Migration to Azure**

## **Title**  
Migration of Presto Server from On-Premises to Azure Virtual Machines  

## **Context**  
Our organization is currently evaluating options for migrating our on-premises Presto deployment to the cloud. After careful consideration, we have decided to migrate Presto to **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)** to leverage scalability, cost optimization, and managed cloud infrastructure benefits.  

## **Decision**  
We will migrate our **Presto database engine** from on-premises servers to **Azure Virtual Machines** as the preferred cloud infrastructure.  

## **Justification**  
After analyzing the requirements and comparing different deployment options, we have chosen Azure Virtual Machines due to the following reasons:  

- **Scalability**: Azure VMs allow dynamic scaling using Azure VM Scale Sets, which ensures efficient resource allocation based on workload demand.  
- **Performance**: Presto on Azure provides better performance with optimized D-series and E-series VMs, ensuring high-speed query execution.  
- **Storage Flexibility**: Migrating datasets from on-prem HDFS to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) provides elastic storage with Parquet/ORC formats for optimized queries.  
- **Networking & Security**: Using private VNets, TLS, and Azure Private Link, we can enhance security while ensuring controlled access.  
- **Cost Optimization**: Autoscaling reduces costs, and Spot VMs can be used for transient workloads, significantly lowering operational expenses.  
- **Reliability & High Availability**: Azure VM Scale Sets ensure automatic failover and redundancy, reducing the risk of downtime.  
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Integration with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics allows for real-time tracking of performance and resource utilization.  

## **Alternatives**  
The other options considered for this migration were:  

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) + Presto** | Auto-scaling, containerized deployment, efficient resource utilization | Higher complexity, requires Kubernetes expertise |
| **Managed Presto (Starburst, Ahana, Synapse, Databricks SQL)** | Optimized performance, managed maintenance | Vendor lock-in, higher cost |
| **Azure Virtual Machines (Selected Option)** | Familiar setup, full control, easy migration | Requires manual scaling unless using VM Scale Sets |

## **Conclusion**  
Based on our analysis, we have decided to migrate **Presto from on-premises to Azure Virtual Machines**. This decision ensures **scalability, performance optimization, cost efficiency, and security**, making it the most suitable choice for our cloud migration strategy.
